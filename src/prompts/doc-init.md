Generate concise project context docs for a codebase. Use your tools (Read, Glob, Grep) to explore the actual code before writing anything.

## Your task

Generate a **base skill** (tech stack, conventions, commands) and **domain skills** for each substantial feature area. Read the actual source files — don't guess from scan results alone. Skip trivial domains.

## Output format

When you are done exploring, output all files wrapped in XML tags:

<file path="{{skillsDir}}/base/{{skillFilename}}">
---
name: base
description: ...
---
[skill content here — may include code blocks, markdown, anything]
</file>

<file path="{{skillsDir}}/auth/{{skillFilename}}">
---
name: auth
description: ...
---
[skill content here]
</file>

<file path="{{instructionsFile}}">
[{{instructionsFile}} content — do NOT include a `## Skills` section or any Skills variant (`## Skills Reference`, `## Skills Overview`, `## Available Skills`, etc.); aspens injects the canonical Skills list deterministically and strips variants]
</file>

**Important:** Use `<file path="...">` and `</file>` tags exactly as shown. Content between tags is written verbatim. Code blocks inside skills are fine — they won't break the parsing.

## Rules

1. **Use YAML frontmatter** with `name`, `description`, and `triggers:` fields (see skill-format above for the `triggers:` schema).
2. **30-60 lines per skill.** Concise and actionable.
3. **Be specific.** Use actual file paths, actual commands, actual patterns you found by reading the code.
4. **Non-obvious knowledge only.** Don't explain what the framework is. Explain how THIS project uses it.
5. **Critical rules matter most.** What breaks if done wrong? What conventions are enforced?
6. Do NOT generate skills for areas with insufficient information. Fewer high-quality skills beat many shallow ones.
7. Skills (`.claude/skills/**`) are the single source of truth for project context — do not invent other context directories.
8. Do NOT include product-specific details you're guessing at. Only what you verified by reading code.
9. Include actual dev/build/test commands from package.json scripts, Makefile, etc.
10. **Read before writing.** Always read the actual source files for a domain before generating its skill. Do not rely solely on the scan results.
11. **Do NOT emit file counts, hub lists, dependency tallies, or "most-depended-on" rankings** in skills or in `{{instructionsFile}}`. The graph hook supplies these dynamically at prompt-injection time. Counts/percentages/file totals/hub rankings/dependency version bumps belong in code-map.md and graph metadata.
