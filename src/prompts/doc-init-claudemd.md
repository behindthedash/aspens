Generate the root project instructions file at `{{instructionsFile}}`. Keep it concise since it is loaded frequently.

{{preservation-contract-refresh}}

## Your task

From the scan results and generated skills, create the root project instructions file covering: repo summary + tech stack, key commands (dev/test/lint), and critical conventions.

**Do NOT generate a `## Skills` section, or any Skills variant** (`## Skills Reference`, `## Skills Overview`, `## Skill Inventory`, etc.). aspens injects the canonical skill list deterministically after your output. Variants will be stripped.

## Output format

Return exactly one file:

<file path="{{instructionsFile}}">
[instructions file content]
</file>

## Rules

1. Keep it concise — this file is loaded often, so shorter is better.
2. Do NOT emit `## Skills` or any Skills-variant heading (`## Skills Reference`, `## Skills Overview`, `## Skill Inventory`, `## Available Skills`, etc.). aspens owns this section; variants will be stripped.
3. Include actual commands from the scan data, not placeholders.
4. Do NOT duplicate what's already in the skills — just reference them by name in prose where useful.
5. Do NOT emit a `## Behavior` section — aspens injects a fixed set of coding guardrails deterministically. Anything you write will be overwritten.
6. **Do NOT emit file counts, hub lists, dependency tallies, or "most-depended-on" rankings.** The graph hook supplies these dynamically at prompt-injection time. Counts/percentages/file totals/hub rankings/dependency version bumps belong in code-map.md and graph metadata, not in `{{instructionsFile}}`.
